  /*
  * Challange #1 â€” 14.09.2018
  * by @Uber.
  * Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at
  * index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original
  * array except the one at i.
  *
  * For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be
  * [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would
  * be [2, 3, 6].
  *
  * Follow-up: what if you can't use division?
